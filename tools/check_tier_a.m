% CHECK_TIER_A  Verify a Tier-A readability edit changed nothing but style.
%   match = check_tier_a(old_file, new_file, renames)
%
% Inputs
%   old_file  path to the pre-edit .m file, char/string
%   new_file  path to the post-edit .m file, char/string
%   renames   Nx2 cell array, {new_name, old_name}; pass {} if the edit
%             renamed nothing
% Output
%   match  true iff canon(new_file), with every new name substituted back to
%          its old name, is byte-identical to canon(old_file)
%
% Applies ASSERT_RENAME_BIJECTION first, then reverses the rename map on
% canon(new_file) with a negative-lookahead regex so a short name (e.g.
% "patch") cannot eat a longer one that starts with it (e.g. "patch_size").
